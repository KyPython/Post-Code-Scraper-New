#Postcode Scraper Demo

This web application showcases my ability to build efficient and scalable solutions for data scraping and storage. The app scrapes postal codes from every state in the USA, and securely stores them in a Supabase database. It demonstrates my expertise in web scraping, database integration, and deploying production-ready applications.

#Key Features
Automated Data Scraping: Efficiently extracts postal codes from targeted sources.
Secure Data Storage: Uses Supabase for reliable and scalable database management.
Cloud Deployment: Fully deployed on Render.com for seamless accessibility.

#Why This Matters
This project highlights my ability to:

Build robust backend systems for data collection and storage.
Work with modern tools like Playwright, Supabase, and Render.
Deliver solutions that are ready for deployment in real-world scenarios.

#How It Works
Python: Core programming language for the scraper.
Playwright: For fast and reliable web scraping.
Supabase: A scalable backend-as-a-service for data storage.
Render: For cloud deployment and hosting.
